Paper report(https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08026v1)
The code is based on the two great work about image augmentation and classfication respectively.

Our objective is to create a system to classify the behaviors of smoking and calling.
We achieved this using the InceptionV3 architecture.

The split_train_val.py and warmup.py are relics of early on in the project's life.
As it stands, the code should not require this data to function as intended.
