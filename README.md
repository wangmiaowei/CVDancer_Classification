# CVDancer_Classification
This a EECS 504 project built by CVdancer group in university of Michigan.
Video and Paper report will be released in future several days.
The code is based on the two great work about image augmentation and classfication respectively.

Our objective is to create a system to classify the behaviors of smoking and calling.
We achieved this using the InceptionV3 architecture.

The split_train_val.py and warmup.py are relics of early on in the project's life.
As it stands, the code should not require this data to function as intended.
